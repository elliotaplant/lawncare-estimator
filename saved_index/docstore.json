If several line items need to be completed together, include notes to the customer and office indicating as much.  It also means every estimate needs to account for set up and clean up time at the beginning and end of the job.\n* Every time a crew shows up at a property they will need to unload and load up the truck with tools and materials.  This is not time to transfer materials from place to place, or haul debris to the trailer.

Even with pictures and drawings, the crews will need to make judgement calls and adjust on the fly, but with clear notes the process is smother, quicker, and with less mistakes.\n \nAs a rule, we avoid supply pictures or drawing to the homeowner.  These notes are intended only for the crew.  They do not need to be pretty, or to scale, but they should convey exactly what work needs to be done.\n \nCreate the crew notes AFTER the work is sold.  If the notes are incredibly simple, and the chances of selling the work is high, go ahead and create and upload pictures, but most of the time wait.  This helps avoid creating polished crew notes for work that does not end up being sold.\n \nPictures\nThe simplest way to provide good visual notes is by taking a picture and then drawing in the changes on the picture.  This can be done in OneNote on a Surface.  It can also be accomplished with OneNote on a phone, though drawing with a finger is much less accurate.

Plant identification can be tricky, and it is impossible to put a plant back that was mistakenly removed. The crews will not remove a plant unless they are confident, they have the right one.

Not perfect (<-- understatement).  We plan on shifting this service in-house as soon as our customer base will support it.

Dethatching removes built up dead grass that can accumulate in a lawn.  This is VERY uncommon in Austin.  It requires healthy grass that grows fast.  Basically, it needs to produce more dead grass and grass clippings than mother nature can decompose and incorporate into the soil.

The sunlight warms the soil and encourages the Bermuda to come out of dormancy faster.

More soil will be better, but it also adds to the cost of the project.\n \nIf you feel the customer is willing to invest in good soil, add it to the quote.  You can add it as an option, or just bundle it into the overall quote.  \n \nWe generally avoid removing too much soil when preparing the area and add back additional soil plus the soil in the sod itself.  Generally, soil levels are higher after installation.  \n \nWe can use two soil types for sod installation, Landscape Soil Mix and regular Topsoil.  \n \nOur standard soil amendment is Landscape Soil Mix from Daniel Stone.  It is 25% Composted Cow Manure, 25% Composted Rice Hulls, 25% Loam, and 25% fine Granite Sand.  We can also use bagged Pro Gro Soil Mix from Whittlesey as it is a similar soil blend.  These soil blends have lots of organic material and is perfect for our poor soil.  This is the go-to soil for most instances.\n \nIn some cases, we can use a simple topsoil instead.  This is usually a straight loam or sandy loam mix.  There is not much organic material in these mixes.  This soil is used if we need to do some grading or increase the soil depth more than an inch or two.  Because this is a mineral soil, it will not decompose.  With new sod, its best to build up the grade with regular topsoil, and then add a compost soil blend over the topsoil before installing sod.  The main advantage is that plain topsoil is less expensive.\n", "doc_id": "55b86eec-660f-45a1-b527-5d45c9c1af52", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e43b6f539b7c0eb86148c3c8ab099d27418d69e766b5b8d8cbf1bc3ff96cdcff", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 78251, "end": 80066}, "relationships": {"1": "Estimator Handbook 6-8-2020.txt", "2": "1729e693-8b93-4be3-ba61-253a767164f9", "3": "459ef9d3-366e-404f-8c0e-18675e6aa56b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "459ef9d3-366e-404f-8c0e-18675e6aa56b": {"__data__": {"text": "bagged Pro Gro Soil Mix from Whittlesey as it is a similar soil blend.

Plants use energy from the sun to grow.  Without the sun, no growth is possible.  There are some grasses adapted to grow in lower light conditions, but even if they will survive, they do not really thrive.  \n \nTraffic over a lawn is also hard on the grass.  There is a reason grumpy old men sit on lawn chairs and yell at kids to get off their lawn.  Thankfully, most lawns get enough sunlight, nutrients and water so that foot traffic is not an issue.  If the grass is healthy enough it will recover faster than the damage can accumulate.  If the traffic is particularly bad, like with sports field, improved maintenance practices can help offset the damage and keep the lawn healthy.\n  \n\n \nThere is no know southern turf grass that can survive both low light and high traffic.  Active kids, dogs, or even the mailman can create heavy traffic areas in shaded lawns.  Re-sodding the high traffic areas, even if a shade tolerant grass is used, is a TEMPORARY solution.

Of these three types, there are dozens of varieties.  As universities and growers develop new varieties of grass, they replace older varieties in the market.  Old lawns typically used older varieties of sod that are no longer available.  Identifying exact varieties is typically not needed.\n \nSt. Augustine Grass:\nSt. Augustine is a common grass type that is popular with some customers.  It is the \"old\" grass, the most common grass type for older properties.

One we do on every property; the other three the crew will only do if they have specific notes.  It is harder for both the customer and the crews to identify unhealthy branches.  If the crew makes a mistake it is unlikely the customer will notice except in the case of dead branches.\nRemove Dead Branches.  \n* This is both common and easy to trim.

Leaves are a \"green\" disposal item that can be recycled.  Disposal is quoted by the trailer load.

We would blow the debris off the roof and then gather it up and dispose of it.  Like every other roof top service, if it is a steep roof or a two-story roof, we will need to harness the guys, so double the labor for the belay.  \n \nDisposal\nDisposal is typically minimal, just a fraction of trailer per house.  The disposal will only need to be increased beyond the minimum when there is a lot of visible debris hanging out of a gutter or if there are piles of leaves and debris sitting on a roof.  Basically never.\n \nEstimate Examples:\nExample 1:  Gutter cleanout for a two-story house with front and back gutters.  The front roofline is 2 stories, but the back is 1 story.  Nothing visible that would adjust the quote.  The quote would be 3 hr. labor and a minimum disposal fee\n \nExample 2: Gutter Cleanout for a two-story house with gutters on all sides, but the left roofline is only one story.  The calculation would be 7 hr. labor, but there is a large tree over the one-story roofline on the left side.  After doubling that side, the estimate would be 8 hours and a minimal disposal fee\n \nExample 3: Gutter Cleanout for a small one-story house with only a single 20-foot gutter over the garage.  The quote would be 2 hrs. with a minimum disposal fee because that is our minimum gutter cleanout quote.\n________________\n\n\n8", "doc_id": "d7d93e3e-550d-454e-a449-fa2a3a10f431", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b83ed65df9dd76973bbcb384ed0833800ec171e38f1783295267bc61b45c9219", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 158211, "end": 160079}, "relationships": {"1": "Estimator Handbook 6-8-2020.txt", "2": "642a031c-6a95-4068-88f8-9a2be9a707cb", "3": "3b2728e4-8ce3-48fb-a9de-2fb6f0196cba"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b2728e4-8ce3-48fb-a9de-2fb6f0196cba": {"__data__": {"text": "house with front and back gutters.

Quoting mulch gets easier the more you do it.  There are two methods of calculating mulch.  The first would be measuring and calculating, and the second would be a rougher eyeball measurement.\n \nHow Deep? Do they need weeding?\nCheck the existing mulch before quoting additional mulch.  It is useful to stop and check several areas in the yard as you work on the quote.  This will help you determine how much mulch is needed.  We usually say 2-3 inches.  The goal is a minimum of 3 inches in open areas, but a maximum of 2 inches up close to plants.  Thick mulch will stop weed growth.  The thicker, the better it works.  But there are typically good plants in the beds we do not want to harm.  If we go too deep, especially right next to plants and trees, bad things happen.

It is time consuming but can be inaccurate if not adjusted for planting material.  With measurements, you are more likely to overquote a job rather than underquote a job.\n \nAs the name implies, you should measure all the bed spaces in a yard and calculate mulch from that point.

Labor is calculated from the amount of mulch and the desired mulch level. \n \nEyeballing mulch, i.e. Magic Finger\nThis is a more difficult method for new estimators because it is based largely on experience.

When we refer to mulch it is a natural mulch, not rubber mulch or rock.\n \nOur mulch is a natural material, composed primarily of decomposed wood fiber and yard waste.  It is produced by shredding the starting material, piling the material up and letting it decompose over time.  The piles are often turned and monitored; the process produces heat, which kills unwanted weeds and seeds.  (It can also spontaneously combust, resulting in mulch fires.)  The result is a loose, dark material perfect for planting beds.  It also produces a product whose volume includes air or voids and is compressible.  \n \nNative Hardwood\nThis is the most common mulch type.  It is a locally produced hardwood mulch.  It has a dark brown color.  The color is the result of decomposition.  This mulch will fade in sunlight but can be turned to bring back the color and to allow the faded mulch to start decomposing again.

It is available dyed Black, Brown, and Red.  Dye is used to try and limit fading when exposed to the sunlight.  This mulch does fade over time, but not as quickly as undyed mulch.  Unlike normal native hardwood, turning the mulch does not cause the color to come back.  Only available from bags.\n  \n\n \nSingle Grind Cedar\nThis is a raw, undecomposed mulch product produced locally from shredded Ash Juniper.  This mulch is usually a red/blond color when installed, but quickly fades to gray in sunlight.  This mulch will take a long time to decompose, both because the wood is resistant to decomposition and because the process has not been started like with native hardwood mulch.  This mulch is generally used in large un-landscape areas or on construction sites to keep down weeds.

This very loose mulch is intended as a playground surface.  It is engineered to absorb impacts and protect children from falls.  Not intended as a planting bed material.  It is sometime used as a pathway material, but it is not good material for this purpose.  Walking through a loose material is difficult.

Occasionally we need to order red dyed mulch, or single or double grind cedar, or playground mulch.  \n \nWe do not try to match the dozens of odd mulches available at big box stores.

Decomposes and feeds the plants\n2. Limits and controls weed growth\n3. Helps retain moisture in the soil\n4.

This simple layer helps limit weeds and keeps the soil more consistent in both moisture and temperature.  What sets mulch apart from other simple ground covers is that mulch decomposes.\n \nAs the mulch naturally decomposes, the bacteria that breaks down the mulch absorb most of the available nitrogen and other nutrients on the top of the mulch.

This eats time and throws off quotes.  It is mostly a problem with bulk mulch and can be tied to how mulch is sold.  Even though we measure and calculate mulch based on volume (cubic feet or cubic yards) mulch volume is variable rather than constant.\n \nWhen mulch is turned or worked in any way, the volume is increased.

Do not quote this type of work for areas that will get a lot of vehicle traffic, like a main driveway or parking lot entrance.  We do not have the expertise or experience to create something able to withstand heavy traffic. \n \nThere are several things that should be done differently for rock intended to support vehicles or heavy weights.   Two of the biggest differences is the type of material used, and the material depth.  \n \nLoose or washed material cannot support much weight.

Do not quote this type of work for areas that will get a lot of vehicle traffic, like a main driveway or parking lot entrance.  We do not have the expertise or experience to create something able to withstand heavy traffic. \n \nThere are several things that should be done differently for rock intended to support vehicles or heavy weights.   Two of the biggest differences is the type of material used, and the material depth.  \n \nLoose or washed material cannot support much weight.  A material containing fines should be used, either for the entire depth, or as a base over which a more decorative rock can be added.  For instance, if someone requests a crushed limestone parking pad, only the top inch to inch and a half should be limestone, and the material under it should be either compacted road base or compacted crushed granite.\n \nMaterial depth should also be deeper compared to walking paths.  The typical walking path should be about 3 inches deep.  To support the weight of a vehicle, 4-6 inches should be used.  The amount of material used is largely dependent on the existing soil conditions, and how much traffic the area is expected to receive.  The sides of roadways usually already have road base, either as the soil, or not far under a thin layer of topsoil.   \n \nWhen installing thick layers of compacted material to support heavy weight, the only big change to the estimate process is to add additional time for compaction.  To compact thick layers of material, only 1-2 inches of material should be compacted at a time.  Soil is added, it is compacted, and then another layer is added and compacted until the total depth is reached.  Double the compaction labor for every 2 inches of material needed.   Regular compaction is 0.5 hours per cubic yard of material.

Dry creek beds can also be combined with simple drains and French drains to create more effective drain solutions.\n \nDry creek beds in their simplest form are shallow ditches lined with rock.  If installed correctly, they can help move water around without creating erosion problems.  Dry creek beds are usually constructed with river rock.  They are built using 1-3 inch and/or 3-5-inch river rock.

They range from common local rock to exotic rock imported from all over the region.  Different types of rock have different properties that make it ideal for different tasks and installations.   Understanding all the variables takes time and experience but the most common rocks and uses are provided below.\n \nRock is a natural material, so there is quite a bit of natural variation.  Rock is generally graded into sizes, but the there is also variation within each size grade.  Check with Daniel Stone, or refer to their material list to see available rock types and graded sizes.\n \nRiver Rocks:\nColorado River Rock\nOur local river rock is called Colorado River Rock, named after the Colorado river, where it originates.  This can be confusing, because there is also Colorado River Rock that originates in the state of Colorado sold at big box stores like Lowes and Home Depot.

Our Colorado River Rock is pulled from local quarries and is a rounded stone of mixed color.  Depending on which quarry the rock was pulled from, there can be a lot of variation in this rock.  It is graded into several sizes, and can be used for erosion control, ground cover, decorative dry creek beds, and other similar uses.  Because the rock is rounded, it is difficult to walk through, and should not be used for paths.  The smaller sized rock constantly shifts under weight making walking difficult, and the larger rock can easily twist ankles because it is such an uneven surface.\n \n  \n\n \nBrazos River Rock\nThis river rock originates from the Brazos River.  It is generally more expensive than Colorado river rock and can sometimes be difficult to source.  Brazos River rock is generally a darker brown color compared to Colorado River rock, and usually has a more uniform color.  It is used in the same ways as Colorado river rock and is generally graded into similar sizes.\n \n  \n\n \nOther River Rocks - Arizona, New Mexico, Sierra, etc. \nThere are other types of river rock available if needed.  These are also graded by size and can be used in place of Colorado or Brazos.  As the names imply, these rocks come from farther away, and the price reflects this.

Types of edging and the installation methods tend to vary from region to region, so be specific in the estimate so the customers' expectations are clearly set.  In other regions edging is often set down into the ground below the soil level, so it is not visible.  \n \nMeasurements\nFor edging, it is tempting to \"eyeball\" the measurement, but where materials are involved it is always better to get a more exact measurement.  The easiest way to measure on site is to either pace off the measurement or use a measurement wheel.  You can also get an accurate measurement using the SAP linear measurement tool, assuming there is good imagery of the space.\n \nRounding up\nAs you measure, round up as you go.  This not only makes the calculations easier; it helps build in a buffer of extra labor and material.  Round up on each section of edging installed rather than round up the single final number.  This tends to inflate smaller sections of edging more than long runs of edging - but this also lines up well with actual labor/installation.  It is more difficult to install multiple small sections than one big run.  The small increase from rounding does not impact over-all prices much, but also ensures our estimates are at least a little bit more accurate.\n \nMaterial\nShovel cut edges do not include material, but steel and chop block will need material.  \n \nSteel edging is sold in 10 ft sections, simply take the linear feet, divide by 10 and round up to the next whole number.

We do not install the flagstones with mortar.  When we install flagstone, it is either set into an existing lawn, ground cover, or directly in the soil.  \n \nSelect Stone Type\nThe stone used is partially a function of design, and partially a function of budget.  See notes below for information on some of the stone we use, but there are literally dozens of other options available from our primary supplier.  Spend some time and figure out something that works best for the property.  A few minutes wandering around the rock yard at Daniel Stone will give you a good idea of what else is available. \n \nWe price the rock as \"select,\" meaning we can hand pick and select each rock and stone we use.  This is more expensive, but helps us get more uniform results, and helps avoid having unusable material left over on a project.  When we install stepping stones, we hand pick stones 2-3 feet across.

The ServiceAutopilot measurement tool is useful for measuring linear distance, but it is not precise enough for patio spaces.  Even though you can use the tool for paths, it is still a good idea to quote the work in person, pacing off the measurement.  It will help you identify odd spacings or corners where an extra flagstone would make the path function better.   \n \nFlagstone Steps:\nThe average size of flagstone stepping stones is 2.5 feet across, and you generally want a 6-inch gap between stones.  This gives you 1 flagstone for every 3 feet of pathway.   Measure the distance the path follows and divide by 3 to get the number of stones you need.  The number should always be rounded up at to the nearest whole number, then add one extra stone.

Daniel Stone includes notes on how many square feet a ton of each material can cover on their material sheet.  You will have to do the math to figure out how many tones of stone are needed.  \n \nWith cut stone, like cut Lueders, you will have to do even more work.

They work equally well through mulch, grass, and rock.  A stepping stone path is a great way to direct foot traffic, give access to spaces, or even tie together desperate areas in a design.\n \nFlagstone can be used in a lawn to create a pathway that avoids wearing or damaging the lawn.

It has a relatively flat surface that is easy to walk on.  \n \nOklahoma sandstone is sold in two primary thicknesses.  Usually, each piece of flagstone is roughly 2-3 feet across.  Both the thickness and the size of each flagstone can vary a lot, even on a single pallet of material.  Generally, there will be a few large pieces, and a few undersized pieces on every project.

In most instances, its best to include elements of a standard drain.\n \nUse a French drain in areas where the soil is saturated over a large area.  This is usually relatively flat spaces with only gradual slopes and grade changes.  It is also most effective at dealing with water saturating the soil, not necessarily water on the surface of the soil.  Surface water is best handled with a simple drain.  \n  \n\n \nNotes on Installing a true French Drain:\nFrench drains can get complicated.  We are not capable of large, complicated drains - so we will keep any French drains we do extremely basic.  \n \nFrench Drains start with a trench.  The top soil should be saved, but a large amount of the material removed will need to be disposed of.

We are not capable of large, complicated drains - so we will keep any French drains we do extremely basic.  \n \nFrench Drains start with a trench.  The top soil should be saved, but a large amount of the material removed will need to be disposed of.  The drain should sit at least 4 inches below the soil, and if a drain pipe is used it will need 4 inches of depth for the pipe.  A good depth for our French drains is 1 foot deep - with 4 inches for the drain pipe, 4 inches of rock, and 4 inches of top soil to cover.  \n \nWe can control the volume of our drain by adjusting the width.  A good standard width is 2 feet wide, but additional width can be added if a lot of water needs to be moved.  A rough rule of thumb is that large loose rock can hold 30-40% of its total volume in water (not including the drain pipe).  That number shrinks as smaller sized rock is used, but it is a useful rule of thumb when you are trying to puzzle out how big a drain needs to be.\n \nThe drain does not need to have a flat bottom.  When using a drain pipe, it is best to position it at the lowest point in the middle of the trench.\n \nWeed fabric is placed over the rock to help keep dirt out.  The fabric can be folded over the edges of the rock as well, but it does not need fabric on the sides.  Most of the water seeps slowly into the drain; if there were faster flowing water it would wash dirt and soil into the rock.  When a catchment basin or drain is used, the water is directed into the drain pipe before diffusing out into the rock, so erosion is not a problem.\n \nIf a discharge point is needed, use the same 4-inch pop up from the simple drains.   Always include a discharge when a box grate is used.  Just like simple drains, try to install the discharge in full sun in the middle of healthy grass.\n \nLastly, the landscape will", "doc_id": "bed7a6a2-9c42-4380-8074-7fcdc1fe9a32", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "bb67ae765b958024a9cac102b02ed75c3d625032331489892579dd7ff9250814", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 297270, "end": 299177}, "relationships": {"1": "Estimator Handbook 6-8-2020.txt", "2": "e1d1799b-759f-405c-b029-0d50525f2e93", "3": "06e4f9ca-f6c0-47af-83b4-32fa507b8f22"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "06e4f9ca-f6c0-47af-83b4-32fa507b8f22": {"__data__": {"text": "point in the middle of the trench.\n \nWeed fabric is placed over the rock to help keep dirt out.

This is usually a sod repair but could include bed modification or repair as well.  See the corresponding sections of the handbook to quote those portions of the quote.\n \nAlternative French Drain designs:\nFrench drains installed without drain pipe, catchment basins, or pop up emitters will often use exposed rock as the capture drain or discharge point.  In these cases, extra rock is used instead of cover soil at the \"top\" of the drain to let water flow freely into the French drain, and then extra rock is used at the \"bottom\" of the drain to let water flow out of the drain.  Quoting this style of French drain is easy, adding a little extra soil disposal, and adding a little extra rock, along with adjustments to the labor.\n \nNatural Seeps:\nThe most common (though admittedly not common) reason to use French drains is in yards with natural seeps.  These are caused when builders or landscapers dig into the side of hills.  They sometimes cut down through the layers of rock and will occasionally hit a layer that is saturated with moisture, causing a sort of spring called a seep.

Weeds are typically less unsightly in lawn spaces that are mowed regularly, but to prevent the spread of weeds they should be dealt with.\n \nKeeping the ground covered, and never having exposed soil helps as well.  Mulch is particularly good at limiting weeds, both as a physical barrier, and biologically by creating a hostile growing environment for seed germination.  Un-decomposed mulches, like single grind cedar, create the best biological barrier, but also pose risks to landscape plants in addition to unwanted weeds.\n \nMulch or rock ground cover can help limit weed growth, but it also helps to have existing plants in a bed.  Planted beds are less likely to invaded by weeds than bare bed space.  Established plants use the water, nutrients, and light that weed seeds need to germinate and grow.  Plants alone will not stop weeds, but it is a part of the weed management equation.\n \nMaintaining plants\nThere are a lot of varieties of plants that can be used in a yard.

Some are easy to grow and maintain, others take more work.  Some are rare, delicate, or special and require unique maintenance.  Almost without exception, people who use landscape maintenance companies stick to plants with more typical maintenance needs.  \n \nWhen we talk about plant maintenance, we are typically referring to trimming the shrubs and plants.  There are several types of trimming done at different times of year.  \n \nUnusual plants/Maintenance requests\nAs a rule, customers that request special attention for specific rare plants are generally passionate home gardeners.  There yards are generally filled with exotic, hard to find plants that require almost daily care.  These customers are generally extremely hard to please and are poor fits for Top Choice - or any other maintenance company.  They tend to be more emotionally attached to their landscape, and having never used professional maintenance companies, they have a hard time understanding that we don\u2019t know how to properly fertilize a one-of-a kind antique rose passed down from their great-great-grand something.  \n \nIt is best to be honest and upfront with these customers and let them know that their plants will not receive the exact care they are requesting.

This process is called dead heading.  Typically, we only do this with roses, but some other common landscape plants, and even trees, will push out new blooms quicker if dead-headed. \n \nDead heading is not included in our bed and shrub services by default, but it can be added to any program by adding an appropriate note for the crew.\n \nDead heading can also be a 1x service.

We often include plant removal as a part of a bed and shrub service.  Whenever we quote plant removal, we need to be a clear as possible in both our estimate description for the customer, and in the notes for the crew.  \n \nIdentify plants:\nTry to identify plants being removed by type, number and location.  For instance, \"remove the six dwarf Burford hollies in the front foundation bed.\"  If we are removing all the beds in a bed, listing each plant is not needed, \"remove all of the plants in the front foundation bed.\"  If you do not know the name of a plant, a simple description works, \"remove the single dead shrub next to the sidewalk,\u201d or \"remove the three decorative grasses by the front right corner of the house\"\n \nPictures:\nAlways take pictures of plants being removed.

It is like shrub trimming; it is easier to figure out when you have experience.  There is no standard time per plant, and the estimates can fluctuate depending on several factors.  \n \nMost often, we are asked to remove living plants that are established long enough to reach maturity and planted in poor soil.  Basically, a standard plant removal is difficult, and most of the things we look at would make the removal easier.  \n \nThings to look out for:\n* Age of the plant (not size - how long it has been in the ground at its current location).  Newly planted shrubs and plants do not have established roots and can often be pulled out by hand in a matter of minutes.  \n* Is the plant alive or dead?  Completely dead plants are easy to remove compared to living plants.  The roots shrivel and no longer grip the ground as well.  Some dead plants can be removed by hand in moments.  Living plants are much harder to remove and require significantly more time.  Living roots grip the soil tight, and resist removal.  Even if a plant only has a little bit of green left it becomes much more difficult to remove.

Often, giving a plant a tug or rocking the trunk a little will let you know if it will be easy or difficult to remove.  Sometimes plants that look dead are dormant from stress - do not assume a dead looking plant will be easy to remove until you check.\n* Size of the plant.  Some large shrubs are treated like trees - roots left in place and trunk cut below soil level.  Large, living shrubs where we remove the roots are the most difficult type of plant removal, and can take more time than removing fully grown trees.\n* Soil condition.  Austin has rocky, or clay soil.  Both make digging difficult and can impact time to remove plants.  Check the soil to see how compacted or rocky it may be - scuffing the top layer with a boot and feeling for compaction is often enough to give you an idea of soil condition.  Mulched beds with a healthy soil bed are easier to deal with.\n* Volunteer plant? - Volunteer plants and trees are wild and grow from seed.

There are two parts, digging up the existing plant, and then replanting in a new location.  We quote all planting based off the plant size, and we can do the same with transplanting.  To do this we need to convert the plant size to its equivalent nursery pot size.  You are trying to estimate the size of the root ball.

Except when quartering or dividing a plant.  In that case, you also need to estimate the rough pot size of the cut portions of the plant.  For instance, dividing a Bi-color iris.

Do not reduce the canopy of most trees, but it would be useful for shrubs or smaller plants.\n \nQuartering/Dividing:\nWhen a plant is being quartered or divided, use the larger pot equivalent to calculate removing the existing plant, and then use the size of the smaller portion for the replanting labor.

Their roots get chopped to pieces, and generally, the plants do not recover unless someone spends a lot of time nursing them back to health.  For our average customer, most plants have a 50/50 chance of surviving.  The chance of death rises significantly for older, well established plants.  A large portion of the plant\u2019s roots will get damaged, which will often outright kill older plants.   \n \nThe second reason is that transplanting is expensive - often as expensive as putting in a new healthy plant.  With transplanted plants, two holes need to be dug, and labor doubles compared to a new plant.  If given a choice between transplanting something with a 50% chance of surviving or putting in a new plant with 95% chance of surviving - and the new plant is a little cheaper - most people elect to have a new plant installed instead. \n \nMost people assume that transplanting is less expensive.

Their reasoning is simple enough.  \"If you're just going to dig it up anyways . . .\"  Digging something up that you intend to transplant takes more time and care compared to ripping it out and tossing it in the trash.  They may save some money on plant material, but they will be paying a lot more for labor.\n \nTransplanting is usually a gamble.  Sometimes it is just a huge waste of money and effort.  It is best to avoid transplanting if possible.\n \nWhen should you transplant?\nThere are instances where transplanting is still practical and can be a good option.  \n \nSome plants are quite easy to transplant and have a much higher survival rate compared to the average plant.  Knowing exactly what will transplant well can take time to figure out, but typically it includes plants that are very hearty and can take a lot of abuse in a yard.  This includes Bi-Color iris, and Crape myrtle trees.  Transplanting these hearty plants is still labor intensive, but a higher chance of survival makes transplanting some plants more practical.\n \nTransplanting may be useful if the plant being moved is not easily available.

Some people have exotic or rare plants that are not available from nurseries.  The chance of death remains, but often transplanting is the only option.\n \nNever transplant in a period of increased stress.  Transplanting just about any plant in late spring or summer is useless - the heat will kill the plant quickly.  Similarly, do not try transplanting cold sensitive plants like cactus in late fall or winter.\n \nThe best times to transplant most plants is in early fall, when it is still warm, but the heat of the summer is gone.  Early spring, right after our last winter freeze is also a decent time to transplant something.\n \nQuartering as Maintenance\nQuartering can be used as a maintenance service used to control the size of certain plants.

The plant produces a thick mat of rhizomes under the soil that gradually expands out in all directions.  Eventually it can outgrow its location.  Cutting back the leaves does not impact the size of the plant.  Quartering is a process where the entire plant is dug up, the thick mat of rhizomes is cut into pieces, and 1/4 of the original plant is replanted to continue growing.  Quartering should be done when the base of the plant has expanded out at least 2.5 feet, but normally is completed when the plant is closer to 3-4 feet across.\n \nBi-Color iris can be quartered at regular intervals to keep the plant in check, and to keep the plant healthy and vigorous.  The frequency of the service depends on how quickly the plant grows.\n \nQuartering other plants\nPlants similar to the Bi-Color iris can be quarter in the exact same way.  This includes Liriope, other irises, daylilies, and monkey grasses.  It may also be useful for clumping bamboo, grasses, and even red yucca.

Usually plants are divided or split to encourage the plant to spread and fill in thicker, rather than to shrink or limit the size of a plant.  A good example of this is liriope used as a border in a planting bed.  The plant can be dug up, split into several pieces, and then replanted only a few feet or a few inches apart to thicken the border.  As the transplanted sections spread and grow, the result is a thicker planting.\n \nThe same process can be used for a plant intended as a groundcover, like dwarf monkey grass, or ajuga.  A healthy clumping plant can be split, and the resulting parts can be replanted to help fill in bare areas.\n \nThis is quoted exactly like quartering, but with every part replanted and no disposal.\n________________\n\n\n16 Debris removal\nOccasionally we get requests to remove large piles of debris for disposal.

Rock is easily identified when exposed bedrock is present, but it is best to assume the soil is rocky on most hills.  The crew always brings a jackhammer to tree installs, but extra time will need to be added.  If solid rock is expected, the install times should probably be doubled.  \n \nWhen a jackhammer is used, only one person can use a jackhammer at a time.  It becomes a bottleneck in the installation.  This is not an issue when we are only installing a few trees but can become a bigger problem on larger tree installs.  If multiple jackhammers would make the work go faster add notes for the crew, and possibly send a note to Operations as well.  They may need to rent a jackhammer or borrow one from a different crew.\n \nAdd Mulch\nNew trees should be mulched.

There are nursery stock standards governing the size of each container class.  There is a range of acceptable sizes for each # - it is not an exact size.  Official measurements use cubic inches not gallons, though in common usage, # is often used interchangeably with \"gallon.\"  A #45 tree is also called a 45-gallon tree.

Trees get significantly more expensive the larger the container size.  Depending on the type of tree, it is not uncommon to have the price double or triple as you move up a size.  The added expense may be worth it to a customer, especially with slow growing trees, or with someone impatient to have shade or a privacy screen.  Often, it is best to quote two size options and let the customer decide how they want to spend their money.\n \nIn general, it is best to use larger sized trees with slow growing species, or if the tree is going to be planted in a prominent or important location.  Smaller tree sizes are best used with decorative trees (generally smaller anyways), fast growing trees, or in areas where the tree has time to grow in.\n \nTo understand roughly how large each tree will be at a given container size, you need to spend a lot of time at nurseries looking at trees.  It helps if you can see a lot of recently installed trees as well.  The more familiar you are with the trees, the easier it will be to select a size that will keep the customer happy.

The hottest and coldest times of the year should sometimes be avoided, but it is common to see trees planted in the dead of winter or the hottest week in the summer.  As a rule, we generally recommend waiting a month for weather to improve, but if a customer insists, we can plant at any time.\n \nFall is the absolute best time of year for planting new trees.

If we are quoting tree staking as a stand-alone service, there is usually something wrong that needs to be corrected.\n \nOne of the biggest things to determine is if stakes will help.  Trees in nature do not have perfectly straight trunks.  Trees grow toward light and can be pushed and shaped by prevailing winds.  These same factors impact plants in a landscape.  A tree planted in a shady location along a house foundation will grow out away from the house toward the sun - regardless of tree stakes.  The same is true of winds.  If a tree is planted on a windy hillside, it will grow in the direction the wind is pushing it.  Stakes may stop some of the wind impact - but the tree will just grow crooked above the stake rope AND it will have a weaker root system because of the stakes.  In nature, the only trees that grow straight and tall are trees growing in a forest or grove where they are sheltered from wind and must grow straight up to reach the sun.\n \nUse stakes on:\n* New trees.

This small decorative tree is native of the Mediterranean region and is sometimes considered an invasive species in our area.  It is often sold from nurseries as small 1-gallon plants, leading many people to mistakenly plant this tree as a small flowering shrub.  It generally reaches 20-25 feet at maturity.  Planted locally for its showy summer blooms, it is grown commercially in north Africa for the medicinal uses of its fruit and seeds.  This is a fast growing, multi trunk tree, with a spreading, crooked growth habit.  It blooms all summer long and will produce more flowers if dead headed regularly.  These trees make great accent trees and lend themselves to many types of landscapes.  It works well in desert type landscapes, as well as more lush green plantings.  These trees are easy to grow and will occasionally spread in the landscape.  Volunteer trees do not breed true to type and are often less showy with smaller blooms and should be removed as a weed.  Avoid planting along green belts or other native areas.\n  \n    \n\n\n \nRedbud \nThis native tree is a good choice for our area.  This small tree is one of the first trees to bloom every spring.

Its branches and trunks are covered with blooms in the early spring before the tree leaves out.  It is an understory tree that grows well under the canopy of larger trees like oaks.  It has large, heart shaped leaves that contrast nicely with our most common oak trees.  It has been cultivated for years as a decorative tree, so many cultivars are available with interesting characteristics.  The \"Forest Pansy\" variety has purple/red leaves that are striking in a landscape, and several varieties can be found with lime green leaves or other leaf colors to add additional color even after the blooms are gone.  These trees are quite easy to grow.  Generally available as a single trunked tree, multi trunk specimens are also available.  It has a natural shrubby growth pattern but can easily be pruned and grown as a traditional tree.\n  \n    \n\n\n \nMexican Plumb \nThis native fruit tree is planted and grown for its white spring blooms.  It will typically start blooming soon after the Redbud tree.  Though not typically planted for fruit production, this tree can be used to cross pollinate more traditional plumb varieties.

It has large purple, very fragrant spring blossom.  The scent has been compared to grape soda or grape bubble gum.  These trees are easy to grow but are slow growing.  It takes decades to reach maturity, and large specimen plants at nurseries are often harvested from the wild rather than grown from seed.  It will produce flowers and add to a landscape while still relatively small, so it is popular even though slow growing.

Sometimes it is a good idea to offer an upgrade option (#1 through #15, with everything 1-2 sizes larger than normal depending on availability)\n \nSome plants have limited size availability.  If you are unfamiliar with the plant it would help to check not only if the plant is available, but what sizes are available.  Static lists are available from some vendors with commonly available plants, sizes, and costs.  These lists do not reflect current inventories but gives you an idea what is potentially available.  Other vendors have online lists given current availability and plant conditions in addition to pricing.\n \nPlant Design\nPlant placement affects overall look and feel of a yard. The same plants can be used in different ways to produce different results. \n \nThere are many different styles of landscape design that use plant selection and placement to create a specific look.  For example, an English Garden uses a combination of formal hedges and foundation shrubs juxtaposed with more natural plantings of flowers and flowering shrubs to create its distinctive look. In our area the Texas Hill Country Landscape is common. This relies on a mixture of rock and mulch ground covers, native plants, relatively sparse plantings with vibrant flashes of seasonal color. \n \nMost yards start with a very generic landscape. These are basic builder-grade landscapes. They are known more for their lack of style rather than using a specific style. As a result, most landscapes are simply evolutions or gradual improvements on generic builder-grade landscapes.

As a result, most landscapes are simply evolutions or gradual improvements on generic builder-grade landscapes. To achieve a more specific look usually requires a significant change to the overall landscape. \n \nMost of the planting and bed installation that we perform is in the realm of minor upgrades and improvements.  It is a good idea to keep any planting changes generic, or at least consistent with the rest of the yard.  \n \nIt is generally not necessary to understand or know the various styles of landscapes.

There is the initial cleanup, site preparation and installation, followed by planting, finishing with mulch/groundcover installation.  The work does not always follow this pattern exactly, but it helps when organizing and creating a quote.\n \nOrganizing the Quote\nThis service can be split out into separate line items if needed.  For instance, typically a bed edge is included in the quote for bed creation.

Both soil mixtures are nearly identical, being composed of 50% compost, combined with top soil and sand.  We use landscape soil mix where large amounts of soil are needed, and typically only use pro-mix when doing minor amendments as plants are installed.\n \nWe have extremely poor soil.  It is typically a good idea to add as much compost and organic matter to our soil as possible.  With existing landscapes, adding organic material is complicated, requiring services like mulching (which eventually breaks down into compost) or top dressing.  During landscape construction or remodeling, the process is much simpler.  We literally just add heaping piles of compost before installing the rest of the landscape.\n \nBecause our existing ground is hard and rocky, we do not till the amendments into the old soil.

We do not grade entire yards or make drastic changes to the existing slope or elevation of the soil.  We do make minor adjustments, particularly when we are creating a large bed space, or re-sodding a section of a yard.  \n \nThough we can remove material to change the grade, the existing rocky, thin soil bed usually requires us to increase the soil depth instead.

The name comes from xeric, a term used to describe plants that use very little water.  Nearly all the plants we use are xeric, and so most of our generic landscapes are xeriscapes.  A good xeriscape is green and lush like any other yard.\n \nWhen people ask for xeriscape, they rarely know what they are asking for - they do not even know what xeriscape is.

This includes the edges of all eves, dormers, domes, and other architectural features on a roof.   \n \nStake Lights - Used to outline parts of the landscape.  Most often used on driveways, walkways, sidewalks, tree rings, bed edges, and other similar\n \nShrub Nets - Calculated and sold by the linear feet, these are lighted nets that drape over shrubs or hedges.  If a shrub or hedge is particularly tall, double the linear feet.\n \nOutlining Arches - Entry arches, and other architectural arches are a common feature on a lot of houses in the area.  We use this term to refer to actual arches, but also to square or other odd shapes like true arches.  These are typically masonry, and have lights stapled only to the outside edge.\n \nOutlining Pillars - This is a less expensive option to wrapping pillars.  Typically, only includes the 2 outside edges of a square pillar.

This method only works with clear line of sight, and on surfaces with regular patterns or composed of evenly sized units.  This works great for most stone and brick features, tile and shingle roofs, and similar features.  \n \nWith roof shingles and tiles, you simply count the number of shingles or tiles along an edge of a roofline.  Standard asphalt shingles are placed every 6 inches, so counting shingles and dividing by 2 gives you linear feet.  Ceramic tiles are generally easier, as the typical spacing is 1 foot, so counting tiles gives you linear feet without needing to convert.  \n \nWith brick or stone, you must measure first, and then count.  In most cases, you can walk up to the building and measure the height of a brick or stone, then you can count the number of bricks or stones and convert to linear feet.\n \nMeasure in person - Mental Ruler:\nThis method can be as accurate as Measure or Count if used properly, and if you have some experience.

In this method you use a known measurement to establish a mental ruler or yardstick, and then use that mental ruler to calculate the linear feet of a feature.\n \nThe easiest length to use as a mental ruler is a 10-foot span.  The initial 10-foot span is measured first and helps insure an accurate quote.  The simplest method on a roofline is to count tiles or shingles to find a 10-foot length of roofline.  That 10-foot section of roofline can then be compared to other sections of roofline to help measure the roof.  This is much faster than counting individual tiles on the entire roof.
